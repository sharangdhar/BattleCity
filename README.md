My project is a game called “Battle City”. It is basically an arcade game.
I have only used Tkinter() and haven’t used any external modules. To compile the code, all you need is a 2.7 or higher version of Python.

The gameplay - 

It has one defender and three enemies. The job of the defender is to protect the eagle and the job of the enemies is to either kill the enemy or the eagle.

To run the game - 

There is a file called “Term_Project.py” in my submission. On compiling that file, a window asking you to press ‘enter’ to continue will appear. On pressing ‘enter’, a window with four buttons will appear with following options.

Option 1 - Play game with level provided
Option 2 - Play game with level created in Level Editor
Option 3 - Level Editor
Option 4 - Quit the Game.

Option 1 and 2 will run the game.
Option 3 will open the level editor wherein the user can make their own level
and play with it. There are two modes in this editor. One is the ‘draw’ mode and the other is the ‘editor’ mode.There is an initial basic level provided.

During the game, if you are the Defender or the Enemy, you will have to control your bot by using Arrow Keys. For firing bullets, you will have to turn in the direction you want to shoot and press ‘spacebar’ for shooting.

The game finishes when either the Defender dies or the enemies die or the eagle dies. On finishing the game, there will be a pause for 2 seconds and then the user will be taken back to the starting screen.


Moreover, I have used pickle to store the boards in the directories and then to read it back again to play on it.
