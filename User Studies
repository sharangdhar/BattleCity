User Studies
I did quite a few User Studies.
User studies in Class – 
I gave my game to 4 people to run – 
The suggestions – 
•	Put a count down Timer at the beginning
•	Give instructions on the starting page
•	Give the user a way to save the board
•	Give an option to drag and make the board.
•	Make the blocks and grass go with the editor during its motion on the drawing board.
•	Don’t use WASD for shooting. Rather shoot in the direction you are pointing. (Given by Sohil Shah)

The changes I made after these studies – 
•	Put a count down Timer at the beginning
•	Gave instructions on the starting page
•	Gave the user a way to save the board
•	Make the blocks and grass go with the editor during its motion on the drawing board.
•	Shoot in the direction I am pointing using space bar.
